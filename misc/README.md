# Our-Shell.

This is a simple UNIX command line interpreter written in C. It provides a
prompt for the user to input commands, executes the commands, and displays the
output.

Welcome to the repository for this simpel shell project

USAGE. To use the Simple Shell, navigate to the directory where the program is
installed and run the executable file Our-Shelll:

./Our-Shell
